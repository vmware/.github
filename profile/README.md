# Welcome!

Collaboration, community and curiosity - all essential to a vibrant open source ethos and part of VMware’s culture. You’ll find us throughout the open source community, contributing to projects like Kubernetes, Linux, and TensorFlow. But we’re also hard at work solving technical challenges with innovative approaches and releasing those ideas as new open source projects. We’re proud of the creativity and contributions of VMware employees - from small but mighty open source projects to large, headline-grabbing community projects.

# Finding your way

If you’re looking for open source projects that serve our technologies such as VMware vSphere® or VMware NSX®, start in the [vmware](https://github.com/vmware) org; you’ll also find projects that address emerging technologies such as blockchain, machine learning, AI and data science. For smaller sample projects and code snippets browse our [vmware-labs](https://github.com/vmware-labs) org and the aptly named [vmware-samples](https://github.com/vmware-samples) org. 

Throughout these collections you’ll discover scripts, libraries, APIs, templates as well as complete solutions such as [Versatile Data Kit](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit) or [VMware Event Broker Appliance](https://github.com/vmware-samples/vcenter-event-broker-appliance).  

Browse the [vmware-tanzu](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/) or the [vmware-tanzu-labs](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/) org to discover cloud native and modern applications related open source - think of Kubernetes and all its surrounding ecosystem. Recommended projects to explore include [Sonobuoy](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy), [Carvel](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel), [Pinniped](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped), and the newest member, [Cartographer](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer). 

There’s even more VMware-backed open source to experience in [Clarity](https://github.com/vmware/clarity), [Spring](https://github.com/spring-projects), [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq), [Project Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt), and [Greenplum](https://github.com/greenplum-db).

As used here, the term 'this License' refers to the specific Covered License being enforced.<br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.<br>
